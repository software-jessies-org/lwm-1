Change Log for "lwm"


2020-04-26	pn	Basel
	Moved geometry declarations from lwm.h to geometry.h.

	Added CreateNamedWindow function in xlib.(cc|h), which does the normal
	create window call but also assigns it a name. This means we can now
	see what each LWM window is for in 'xwininfo -root -tree'.


2020-04-25	pn	Basel
	Gave xlib.(cc|h) a namespace, and added there a bunch of shim functions
	which call same-named Xlib functions. Changed code around LWM to call
	through these new shim layers. The idea is to make it easier to track
	events sent to clients, and thus make it simpler to debug problems such
	as the disappearing ImageMagick windows.


2020-04-18	pn	Basel
	Deleted support for colormaps. 24bpp has been standard for decades.


2020-04-15	pn	Basel
	Was bitten by a Google Chrome update, which caused Chrome windows to
	drop all keyboard input for windows which weren't freshly opened.
	Figured out a fix for it, which still works for Java.


2019-09-15	pn	Basel
	Stopped 'withdrawn' windows from showing up in the unhide menu. This
	solves a bug where the rhythmbox preferences dialog would remain in the
	unhide menu even when closed, because the window was never destroyed,
	merely withdrawn (and reused again when next opened).


2019-09-01	pn	Basel
	Removed the poisonous 'PointerMotionHintMask', which was causing us to
	miss out on mouse motion events, and preventing the cursor from being
	properly updated according to which bit of the window furniture it was
	on. Also fixed a silly bug where we'd fail to switch to the
	'move window' cursor should the pointer move from the client window
	into the title bar.

	Got rid of the long-standing bug where we'd allow the window to be moved
	if the mouse pointer is on the furniture window's 1px border.


2019-08-29	pn	Basel
	Got rid of static functions to improve debugging.

	Added backtrace printing (for linux only so far) on X proto errors.

	Added reference counting and proper clean-ups of image icons for deleted
	windows. This fixes a pixmap leak, and also some bad over-cacheing
	behaviour where sometimes apps get each other's icons.


2019-05-25	pn	Basel
	Fixed sloppy divide-by-zero bug in xrandr window moving code.


2019-05-20	pn	Basel
	New algorithm for calculating where to position windows after a change
	of screen layout.

	This also introduces 'tests.cc', LWM's first ever unit tests! They're
	not using any standard library, and are compiled into the main binary
	(call by running 'lwm -test'). This isn't strictly proper unit testing,
	but it means I don't need to bother with a more complicated Makefile.
	And since LWM really isn't set up for easy unit testing (still having
	nearly everything in lwm.h), doing things properly would involve serious
	refactoring. Anyway, as far as I can tell, adding the tests in this way
	increases the binary size by 71KiB, which isn't going to hurt anyone.


2019-05-07	pn	Basel
	Fixed calculation of the title bar bounds, so that we don't have a
	little square at the right edge of the title bar, which is a resize
	widget when it should be a move one.

	Fixed the parsing of numeric Xresources so they don't treat all 0 values
	as being parse failures. This allows the top-of-window size-change area
	to be switched off (previously it would have fallen back to the
	default).


2019-05-05	pn	Basel
	Added back the ability to resize windows by dragging the top edge of the
	window frame. There's a new xresource called 'topBorder' which describes
	how many pixels thick this is (so it can be a different thickness to the
	normal window border); setting this to zero makes the whole title bar
	a move, not resize, widget. JFC likes resizing from the top, so this
	should make this branch of LWM more appealing.

	Added an 'appIcon' Xresource, which allows application icons to be
	enabled or disabled for title bars and the unhide menu.

	Fixed another little bug where LWM was moving menu's window on shutdown.
	This was caused by Client_MakeSane always subtracting textHeight() from
	the Y position, irrespective of whether the client is framed. The
	treatment of window sizes *really* needs more structure.


2019-05-03	pn	Basel
	Fixed another silly bug where strutted windows would be forcibly pushed
	out of their reserved areas.


2019-05-02	pn	Basel
	Fixed a silly bug where strutted windows would be forcibly pushed out of
	their own reserved areas on an xrandr screen change.


2019-05-01	pn	Basel
	Added 'xdbg.cc', a simple debug tool to measure locations on screen.
	Useful for debugging mouse positioning issues with LWM.

	Finally fixed LWM's issues with popup windows being opened outside
	the visible area of the screen (happens after a few laptop external
	screen add/remove sequences, with evergreen and terminator).


2019-02-27	pn	Basel
	Embellished debug handler a bit, added support for enabling debug
	logging per client. Should help me figure out various bugs.


2019-02-23	pn	Basel
	Rewrite of the click/drag handling. This gets rid of the global vars
	tracking which 'mode' we're in, and which window is being dragged and
	from where. Instead, on commencement of a drag we create an instance
	of a class which knows how to handle the specific action.
	Because we're no longer assuming the window with input focus is the one
	being dragged, this eliminates a whole bunch of annoying bugs, like a
	new window appearing during a drag causing the new window to suddenly
	be the one being moved.


2019-02-09	pn	Basel
	Rewrite of the way we handle xrandr notifications, so we can support odd
	shapes caused by multiple screens (which can cause inaccessible areas).


2019-01-09	pn	Basel
	Fixed a regression in the way the mouse pointer's cursor was set, such
	that we don't keep showing the 'resize corner' icon (or whatever LWM
	last set) when the pointer is hovering over the client window. This was
	particularly evident in clients that aren't too militant in their cursor
	setting, like Rhythmbox for example.


2019-01-02	pn	Basel
	Discovered XSetIconSizes, and used it to specify LWM's preferred icon
	size range. This prevents Java from using butt-ugly down-sampling to
	squeeze the image into 16x16 pixels (which is the default if no
	WM_ICON_SIZE property is present). Now Evergreen and Terminator app
	icons look much nicer (although we could do better by not down-sampling
	ourselves).

	Changed window icon handling so we create 3 scaled-down versions, for
	the menu, active and inactive window titles. The scaling now uses
	simple anti-aliasing (made possible by the baked-in alpha channel).
	This makes window icons look *MUCH* smoother.

	Added a little extra padding in the unhide menu, so that the mouse-over
	highlight extends a little to the left and right of the text. Just a
	minor prettiness improvement, but it does look nicer.

	Added back click-to-focus mode. Also added a testXresources file, so
	the interpretation and support for the various Xresources can be easily
	tested.

	Fixed a regression which caused unhidden windows to appear lower than
	they should be.


2019-01-01	pn	Basel
	Added support for fetching the window icon from the _NET_WM_ICON
	property. This method of specifying icons is used by Chromium/Chrome.

	Added (cached) auto-rescaling of window icons, to shrink them down to
	the size we want for displaying. This makes Firefox and Chromium icons
	look like they should, rather than just a tiny swatch from their middle.

	Close icon now still drawn for inactive windows, but with a different
	colour (defaults to the same grey as inactive window titles).


2018-12-31	pn	Basel
	Replaced the ugly global 'current' pointer use (and static 'last_focus')
	for tracking input focus with a proper focus-tracking class, that can
	maintain more than one item of history. By cleaning the focus-tracking
	code up, the annoying Terminator focus bug now goes away.

	Changed the close icon action bounds to be larger, down to the client
	window and across to the title bar area, which works more nicely
	particularly on large 4k screens.


2018-12-08	pn	Basel
	Updated this ChangeLog from the log I'd been keeping elsewhere.

	Updated BUGS and other files. Will be tracking bugs/feature ideas in
	the BUGS file from now on. It contains some useful debugging tools too.

	Made a bunch more colours configurable, including all the text, popup
	background and foreground.


2018-12-07	pn	Basel
	Updated man page.

	Fixed treatment of pending windows so we keep track of the frame
	window ID, rather than a pointer to a Client that might disappear from under us.


2018-12-01	pn	Basel
	Lots of changes. Give it nicer colours than black+white, added simple
	icon support, rewrote hiding logic, etc.

	Added display of a red box showing where the to-be-unhidden window is,
	when the pointer is hovering over the Hider menu.


2018-09-10	pn	Basel
	Fixed an annoying crash bug that can happen on closing windows, due to
	global Client pointers being kept around.

	Sanitised header files a bit, adding include guards and moving most of
	the X11/ .h includes to xlib.h.


2018-09-02	pn	Basel
	Hardened calls to XGetWindowProperty a bit, zero-initialising stuff.
	This is an attempt to fix some random occasional crashes I see on Linux
	when restoring colour maps.

	Added some padding to the 'hidden windows' menu, as the contents was
	hard to read.


2018-08-24	pn	Basel
	Fixed the Y positioning of title bar text - it was a bit low.

	Changed the pop-up menu to use freetype fonts.

	Changed the menu text creation to handle UTF8 truncation properly.

	Changed the menu text creation to run each time it's needed, to cope
	better with screen size changes.


2018-08-18	pn	Basel
	Fixed crash bug, caused by not creating a Client in the C++ way.

	Changed title bar font rendering to use freetype - looks much nicer.

	Removed special cases for where three's no UTF8 support - there always
	is these days.


2018-05-18	pn	Basel
	Close the 'resizing window dimensions' window if we flip out of weird
	dragging mode.


2018-05-13	pn	Basel
	Switched Bool/True/False to bool/true/false, and simplified some code.

	Moved away from global variables for Resources.

	Switched from old C strings to std::string for window names.


2018-05-10	pn	Basel
	Broke out XQueryTree into a C++ function which can return a struct
	which is initialised safely, and has a save 'destructor' (C-style;
	switching to C++ entirely will take time).

	Renamed all .c files to .cc, and fixed the code up so it worked with
	g++ (eg 'class' -> 'c_class').


2018-05-03	pn	Basel
	Fixed a crash bug where an uninitialised variable was iterated over
	(last arg to XQueryTree).


2018-05-01	pn	Basel
	Always give focus to newly-opened windows. This fixes the annoying
	problem of newly-opened Chrome windows being unfocused, and me entering
	random URLs and search terms into GMail.

	Fix last-focused restoration, so that closing a just-opened window
	(eg ctrl-w in chrome) gives focus back to where it just came from.


2018-04-27	pn	Basel
	Changed window drag code to auto-disable if the mouse buttons aren't
	down. Should fix the random-drag bug.

	Refactored the getMousePosition function so it returns a little struct
	with x, y, and now modMask.


2018-04-16	pn	Basel
	Added support for the desktop dimensions changing, with auto window
	rearrangement. Now I can use LWM seamlessly on my work laptop :-)


2018-04-15	pn	Basel
	Fixed annoying resize bug where a window's bottom-right edge would zoom
	away from the screen edge if the window was resized from the top-left
	corner to violently.


2018-04-08	pn	Basel
	Changed 'unhide' menu to include visible windows, separated from the
	hidden ones with a dotted line.

	Added more nice event debugging printers.

	Fixed: opening new windows didn't display them as having focus.


2018-04-07	pn	Basel
	Added some debugging, so I can see what's happening to it.

	Added a --debug-events flag, to switch on/off detailed event display.

	Fixed the bug which prevented Terminator's find box from opening.


2018-03-25	pn	Basel
	Created my own LWM branch.

	Wrote better sloppy focus fix, got it pushed to github.

	A few minor free statement improvements.


2018-03-24	pn	Basel
	Figured out cause of sloppy focus bug for Java, made first hacky fix.


2016-02-12	jfc	York
	Patches from Greg Kenneky and other fixes for fullscreen windows.

	Released lvm-1.2.4.

2013-07-09	jfc	York
	Applied a couple of minor patches suggested by Jari Aalto, the
	Debian package maintainer.

	Released lwm-1.2.3.


2009-11-24	jfc	York
	Released lwm-1.2.2.

2009-11-20	jfc	York
	Improved performance by only checking for pending X events when the
	socket it ready for reading.

	Fixed applyGravity() bug that caused frameless windows to be
	mis-positioned.

	Applied a workaround in destroy() to avoid error reports when closing
	windows.

2005-01-28	jfc	York

	Applied a patch from Chris Reece that ensures that the popup
	menu does not disappear off the bottom of the screen.

2004-09-30	jfc	York

	Fixed an issue with IRIX 6.5 and lwm, where the root menu could
	not be used because motion events had coordinates with respect to
	the popup, not the root. Fixed by explicitly using the root window
	coordinates.

	Released lwm-1.2.1.

2004-09-28	jfc	York

	Added missing -lSM to no_xmkmf_makefile.

2003-12-09	jfc	York

	Fixed bug (reported by Matthew Wilcox) where windows with extremely
	long names could cause the pop menu to be unusable. Fixed by
	maintaining a separate, shortened name for the menu, if
	necessary ("this is a very very [...] ry long window name"). This
	takes no account of UTF-8 names as yet.

2003-12-08	jfc	York

	Fixed bug (reported by Eugene Wong) where resizing the top of
	a window would cause it to jump up several pixels. The height of
	the titlebar was not being considered when calculating mouse
	motion in reshaping_motionnotify().

	Modified manage() to avoid autoplacing windows during
	initialisation.

	Released lwm-1.2.0.

2003-12-03	jfc	York

	Applied patch from Elliott that gives focus to new windows in
	click-to-focus mode.

	Changed the buttonpress code in disp.c to ignore scroll wheel
	"clicks".

	Modified Client_Remove so that, in click-to-focus mode, it
	refocuses on the most sensible window (either the top window,
	or the window that the closing window was a transient for).

	Attempted to fix the edit placement bug by adding titleHeight()
	to the supplied X coordinate during a ConfigureRequest event,
	and not attempting to fix clients that don't supply a border
	width during a configure request.

	Fixed fullscreen-mode bug where galeon windows appeared to jump
	up and to the left after the first click.

	Released lwm-1.1.7.

2003-11-28	jfc	York

	Changed the behaviour when unhiding a window in click-to-focus mode.
	An unhidden window now automatically gets focus in this mode.

	Fixed a small bug in the session management code that could
	cause a crash when lwm quit.

	Moved a call to ewmh_set_client_list make before ewmh was
	initialised.

	Changed lwm's behaviour when minimising windows. Button three must
	now be pressed and released before the window is hidden (or
	moved to the bottom of the stack). This ensures that lwm swallows
	all the events generated during the operation, and allows the user
	to back out of the operation by moving the mouse out of the window
	before releasing the button.

	Removed include of Xm/MwmUtil.h in manage.c, and the HAVE_MOTIF
	kludge from the Imakefile, in favour of copying the few lines
	that are required from Xm/MwmUtil.h (LessTif, so hopefully no
	licensing issues).

	Fixed bug that caused the last cursor displayed in a frame
	to be incorrectly used when moving into the frame when the
	root menu was on screen. This is done by brute force -
	see Client_ResetAllCursors().

	Released lwm-1.1.6.

2003-11-26	jfc	York

	Fixed bug in Client_MakeSane that caused occasional crashes
	during window moves/resizing. Should investigate why it occasionally
	gets called with a NULL client.

2003-11-03	jfc	York

	Added an entry for LeaveNotify in the dispatch table (disp.c).

2003-08-13	jfc	York

	Removed "error" message when lwm fails to connect to a session
	manager. This isn't actually an error and the message is confusing.

2003-08-01	jfc	York

	Fixed bug that allowed clients to grab the focus and confuse lwm.

	Cleaned up the code for raising and lowering clients, and added
	code to prevent a client from being raised above its transients.

	Retired disp.old, and CLOSE_PATCH.txt.

	Added an edge resistance to the workarea, so that window may
	be moved to the edge of the workarea without precise mousing,
	as requested by MAD. EDGE_RESIST in lwm.h defines the number of
	pixels of resistance and may be safely set to zero.

	Released lwm-1.1.5.

2003-07-31	jfc	York

	In click-to-focus mode, always draw the box in the frame.

2003-07-29	jfc	York

	Added a click-to-focus mode. The default remains (sloppy)
	enter-to-focus.

	Released lwm-1.1.4.


2003-07-28	jfc	York

	Updated no_xmkmf_makefile to reflect the changes made since 1.01.

2003-07-10	jfc	York

	Fixed a bug in manage.c than prevented lwm compiling on systems
	with no variety of Motif installed. If this means you, remove
	_DHAVE_MOTIF from Imakefile.

	Released lwm-1.1.3.

2003-07-08	jfc	York

	Added support for NET_MOVERESIZE, but I cannot find any
	applications the want to use it, apart from the keyboard
	variants. I don't know what to do about the keyboard move/resize.

2003-07-03	jfc	York

	Fixed a few buglets thrown up by running lwm through the compiler
	with all warnings on.

2003-07-02	jfc	York

	In Client_MakeSane(), added a check to prevent windows being
	moved into a position where they might be completely obscured
	by panels/docks.

	Changed ewmh_set_strut() to run Client_MakeSane() across all
	clients when the work area changes. This avoids clients getting
	lost behind panels/docks.

	Added support for _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE and
	_NET_WM_STATE_BELOW. Added fix_stack() to maintain the window
	stack as dictated by the EWMH spec.

2003-07-01	jfc	York

	Added support for _NET_WM_STRUT. lwm now maintains _NET_WORKAREA
	correctly, and takes the reserved space into account in its
	window placing algorithm.

	Released lwm-1.1.2.

2003-06-30	jfc	York

	Fixed bug that caused tk menus to be badly placed placed by
	sending a configure notify where appropriate in setactive().

	Removed compile time option of prepending window title's with
	the client machines's name (PREPEND_CLIENT_MACHINE).

	Added i18n support for window titles, using UTF8 names from
	_NET_WM_NAME where available and supported (ie XFree86).

	Added code in disp.c to change the pointer in some areas of the
	frame to indicate the action taken by button1. I didn't allow the
	"move" pointer in the titlebar because it looked nasty. Added
	the xkill pointer for the the box. This was a TODO item.

2003-06-28	jfc	York

	Added GPL headers to all the source files.

	Released lwm-1.1.1.

2003-06-27	jfc	York

	Fixed the bug where each GTK window generated an extra
	window when lwm shut down by unmapping all the clients in
	Client_FreeAll(). Elliott thinks this is bad magic, and that
	the X server should lose the windows, but this doesn't happen
	with XFree86.

	Fixed bug, reported by Ed Porter, that caused moving the mouse
	wheel to generate xterms. Wheel mice generate button press events
	on buttons 4 and 5 and shell() wasn't taking this into account.

	Fixed silly bug in motifWouldDecorate(): windows should have a
	frame is MWM_DECOR_ALL is set.

2003-06-26	jfc	York

	Shaped windows now work again. I'm not sure what I changed
	to break it, but the fix was to process shaped windows in
	scanWindowTree (they were previously ignored). They had to be
	clients anyway, if they were to appear in _NET_CLIENT_LIST.

2003-06-25	jfc	York

	Fixed bug that caused frameless windows to be immoveable.

	In manage.c, allowed lwm to fall back on Motif hints when
	deciding if a window should have a frame, if _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE
	is not set. This breaks the EWMH spec, in that a window
	without _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE should be assumed to have
	_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL, but it's the only way for older
	apps to indicate that they don't want decorating, and in the
	absence of Motif hints the default state is
	_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL.

2003-06-24	jfc	York

	Fixed the following TODO item:
		allow users to back out of closing a window if
		they leave the box before letting go of the button.
	Implemented by adding an extra wm_closing_window mode rather
	than adding to the Client structure, as per AMidthune's
	patch. Not sure which is the better solution, though.

	Added initial support for _NET_WM_STATE, but only for
	_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR, _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER and
	_NET_WM_HIDDEN.

	Added simple hardwired _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS support, and
	support for the _NET_CLOSE_WINDOW client message.

	First attempt an _WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN and a full-screen mode.
	It's not quite right yet, but useable.


2003-06-23	jfc	York

	Fixed some silly bugs in the session management code.

	Added initial EWMH code using the 1.2 spec:
	http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/1.2/html/
	Initial support covers the mechanisms for announcing support
	for EWMH (_NET_SUPPORTED, _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK), the
	client list and active client (_NET_CLIENT_LIST and
	_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW), and the window type (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE).
	Windows may now be frameless if their window type indicates.

2003-06-21	jfc	York

	Added session management so that GNOME2's gnome-session does
	not wait a long timeout when starting the window manager.

2000-02-08	enh	Basel

	Tried out a patch from Robert Bauer so that it's possible to move
	windows with button 1, if you're in the ``titlebar'' (i.e. not touching
	the top border). This makes it easier for Windows users to cope
	with lwm, and easier for those with two-button mice (or laptops)
	too. At the moment, "mv disp.old disp.c" will give back the old
	behaviour.

1999-11-11	enh	Basel

	Fixed a cut-and-paste bug in client.c that made the check for
	a window being too large or too small wrong. This bug was found
	by Mike Meyer.

1999-09-22	enh	Basel

	Altered the button-press code so that it's now easier for unhappy
	users to alter which button performs which function. Simply edit
	lwm.h and modify the three relevant #define statements.

1999-07-19	enh	Basel

	Added a handler for circulation events so that other programs
	can offer "Alt-Tab" functionality.

1999-07-08	enh	Basel

	Fixed the cosmetic problem with titlebars of dialogue boxes. If
	this looks to be OK, I can think about another lwm release.

1999-06-10	enh	Basel

	Incorporated bug fix by Adrian Colley regarding the attempt in
	manage.c to call XSetWindowBorderWidth on an InputOnly window,
	and moved the #include of <signal.h> after <sys/types.h> so that
	lwm can compile on Solaris 2.6. Cosmetic change to move the close
	box to line up with the client window. The effect is spoilt if the
	child insists on drawing a black border around itself, though.

1999-02-07	enh	Basel

	Title-bars no longer pop up and down. An inactive window has a
	grey title instead. This means less load on the server, no annoying
	"I want to type the information from one window's title-bar into
	the current window but can't" syndrome, and a final solution to
	the race condition that's been with us since the very beginning.

	The size feedback no longer pops up as soon as you grab a window,
	because that made it almost impossible to grab a window without
	resizing it.

1998-11-03	enh	Basel

	The size feedback now pops up as soon as you grab a window,
	rather than waiting for you to actually move.

1998-10-06	enh	Basel

	Al pointed out that my Sun actually has two framebuffers. One
	monitor-lugging later, and I suddenly have a need for a window
	manager that can cope with multiple screens. And here it is!

1998-05-29	enh	Basel

	Fixed window minimum/maximum height code so that it no longer
	includes the title decoration. Menu now pops down if a window
	disappears while the menu is up.

1998-03-23	enh	Basel

	Removed unused constant. A little tidying up, renaming.  Some
	debugging code removed. The width of the size-feedback window
	is now calculated at run-time depending on the size of the screen.

1998-02-05	enh	Basel

	Fixed bug found by Marty Olevitch: lwm's automatic window
	placement heuristics broke down when either the right or bottom
	of the display were reached.
	Changed menu placement to ensure that the menu is fully
	on-screen.

1998-01-06	enh	Basel

	Fixed bug found by J. Han whereby lwm dumped core if a window
	disappeared while being reshaped.

	"Push to back" functionality moved from button 3 click in box
	to button 3 click anywhere in frame with Shift held down.

1997-08-29	enh	Basel

	Simple version numbering introduced.

1997-08-25	enh	Basel

	Fixed stupid mistake introduced with the last change, with regard
	to setting the input focus.

	Xt applications (strictly, applications whose window title is
	the same as their class hint resource name) no longer have a
	title bar. This means it's more awkward to kill them, but that
	they don't have pointless decoration.

1997-08-07	enh	Basel

	Bug related to hiding windows fixed.

1997-08-06	enh	Basel

	The size indictor now has the correct GC settings. Whoops!
	Improved handling of WM_NORMAL_HINTS. Amongst other things,
	this means that size reporting of xterm et al is more reliable.

	Reshaping now uses the popup to display the current width and
	height of the window being reshaped (in whatever units it uses).

	Clicking button 3 on the "box" pushes the window to the bottom.
	Changing image in xv no longer causes the window to gravitate to
	the southeast. There's an ICCCM convention that clients should
	set the border width with each ConfigureWindow request. As usual,
	many clients fail to follow this convention. I get the distinct
	impression that the very reason for the existance of the Xt
	library is because the X11 protocol and ICCCM are so messy and
	involved that the only way to make X11 bearable was to write
	this code once and for all. The menu code has been rewritten,
	changing as a side-effect the order in which hidden windows
	appear on the menu. The rewrite now means that the order is very
	easy to change for experiments like alphabetical ordering etc. I
	like it as it is: a stack.

	Now handles NoExpose events. Better protocol error reporting.
	Default minimum size calculation improved.

1997-06-23	enh	York

	Both button 1 and 2 can now have commands associated with them.
	See the documentation for details. Windows whose minimum and
	maximum sizes are identical can no longer be resized. The
	oscillation race condition is now less likely to occur. Some
	dead code removed.

1997-05-25	enh	York

	lwm now does the right thing with respect to hidden windows on
	exit and startup. a hidden window is now re-hidden if lwm exits
	and is then restarted.

1997-05-21	enh	York

	Fixed a bug that meant a client could confuse lwm by remapping
	a hidden window: the menu of hidden windows wasn't being updated.

1997-05-16	enh	York

	A bug relating to ConfigureRequests on the current window caused
	the title-bar to be redrawn incorrectly. Once again, this came
	to light with xv.

	The "New Shell" command has gone from the button 3 menu, and
	button 2 now performs this function.

1997-05-09	enh	York

	This version fixes a bug relating to ConfigureRequests. Client
	windows that were resized under program control were resized,
	but the client was misinformed as to what change had actually
	taken place. xv's optimised redraw, for example, missed out on
	part of the window because of this.
	The behaviour with regard to hidden windows on exit has also
	changed. They're now remapped, but lowered in the window stack.
	This means that you don't lose them, but that they don't
	obliterate the more important windows on your screen if you kill
	the window manager.
